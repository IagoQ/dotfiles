description: Break down a spec into sprints and atomic tickets

Read the spec file at: $ARGUMENTS

If you were to break this project down into sprints and tasks, how would you do it (timeline info does not need included and doesnt matter) - every task/ticket should be an atomic, commitable piece of work with tests (and if tests don't make sense another form of validation that it was completed successfully), every sprint should result in a demoable piece of software that can be run, tested, and built on top of previous work/sprints. Be exhaustive, be clear, be technical, always focus on small atomic tasks that compose up into a clear goal for the sprint.

Once you're done, use the Task tool to launch a Plan agent to review your work and suggest improvements. After reviewing the suggested improvements, write your tasks/tickets, sprint plans, etc to a markdown file in the same directory as the original spec, named `<spec-filename>-sprint-plan.md`.
